**Study of signals and systems**

** Lab Objectives**

 The objectives of this lab are:
- Understanding and plotting specific signals: signum, rectangular, triangular,
 sinc, impulse, step, square, discrete exponential, and discrete cosine.
- Using subplots to analyze the relationship between frequencies for discrete cosine and exponential signals.
- Calculating inner products of signals and use them to compute energy
 and power, comparing hand calculations with code results.
- Stating and verifying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
- Classifying systems based on linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability.
- Performing advanced signal operations and analyze their properties
