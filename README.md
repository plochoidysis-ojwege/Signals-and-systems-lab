**Study of signals and systems**

** Lab Objectives**
 The objectives of this lab are:
- Understand and plot specific signals: signum, rectangular, triangular,
 sinc, impulse, step, square, discrete exponential, and discrete cosine.
- Use subplots to analyze the relationship between frequencies for dis
crete cosine and exponential signals.
- Calculate inner products of signals and use them to compute energy
 and power, comparing hand calculations with code results.
- State and verify the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
- Classify systems based on linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability.
- Perform advanced signal operations and analyze their properties
