# Study of signals and systems

## Lab Objectives

 The objectives of this lab are:
- Understanding and plotting specific signals: signum, rectangular, triangular, sinc, impulse, step, square, discrete exponential, and discrete cosine.
- Using subplots to analyze the relationship between frequencies for discrete cosine and exponential signals.
- Calculating inner products of signals and using them to compute energy and power, comparing hand calculations with code results.
- Stating and verifying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
- Classifying systems based on linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability.
- Performing advanced signal operations and analyze their properties.

### Hand calculation

These were calcuation by hand  https://github.com/plochoidysis-ojwege/Signals-and-systems-lab/blob/main/Signals%20and%20systems%20lab%201/Results/calculations%20by%20hand/hands.pdf

### The codes
Further , the code results mosly matched the hand calculations, with negligable differences(floating-point precision in MATLAB gave a very small residual) .Here are the codes :
